hi# Freelancer Platform

## Project Description

The Freelancer Platform is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that connects clients with freelancers in a trustless, transparent environment. The platform eliminates intermediaries by using smart contracts to handle job postings, applications, payments, and dispute resolution automatically.

### Data Structures

- **Job**: Contains job details, budget, deadline, and status
- **Application**: Freelancer proposals with bid amounts
- **User**: User profiles with reputation and skills

### Security Features

- Role-based access control with modifiers
- Secure escrow with automatic payment release
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Emergency withdrawal functionality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- MetaMask wallet configured
- Test ETH for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FreelancerPlatform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Usage Examples

#### Register and Post a Job
```javascript
await contract.registerAndPostJob(
    "John Doe",                    // name
    "JavaScript, React, Node.js",  // skills
    "Build a DeFi Dashboard",      // job title
    "Need a responsive dashboard", // description
    Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 7 * 24 * 3600, // deadline (7 days)
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") } // budget
);
```

#### Apply for a Job
```javascript
await contract.applyAndManageJob(
    1,                           // job ID
    "I can build this for you",  // proposal
    ethers.utils.parseEther("0.8"), // bid amount
    0,                           // action (apply)
    0                            // applicant index (not used for apply)
);
```

#### Complete and Pay
```javascript
// Freelancer marks as complete
await contract.completeAndPay(1, 0); // action 0 = mark complete

// Client approves and pays
await contract.completeAndPay(1, 1); // action 1 = approve & pay
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Security Considerations

- All funds are held in escrow until completion
- Multiple security modifiers prevent unauthorized access
- Comprehensive event logging for transparency
- Dispute resolution mechanism for problematic cases
- Emergency functions for critical situations
